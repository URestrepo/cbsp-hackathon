# Ideas for the hackathon
Make sure to look at the introduction first, specifically the notebook on how
to use the REST APIs: [../0-introduction/README.md](0-introduction/README.md).

Example ideas are described in the READMEs of each subdirectory. If you
implement an idea please send a Pull Request with your notebook included in
that folder.
